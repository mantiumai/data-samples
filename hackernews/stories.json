We&#x27;re starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site&#x2F;Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site&#x2F;Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world&#x27;s leading tech companies).<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub.",

        "Body": "With the recent development in AI, for example stable diffusion, my hobby as an artist has been almost non-existent. No matter how much time I spend on my art, I will not be able to compete with AI models. These things are not going to slow down. Often times, I feel like the process of using AI-generated art and augmenting it with my own projects is more productive than creating my own art from scratch.<p>Adding ChatGPT to the equation, the threat has doubled. It has just started, yet it can do remarkable things. This is like the AlexNet moment in the field of computer vision. There was a time before AlexNet. Now, most research and implementation involved using deep learning in one form or another. I have been in this field for a long time, but I don&#x27;t have any substantial work to show for it. I feel like my effort wouldn&#x27;t make a difference. As long as I am improving, these models are able to improve at a faster rate. Of course, I cannot compete with the top researchers at these big labs. So whatever I do will be insignificant.<p>I have been trying to change my field from AI to something else, but it feels like that would be a wrong decision. However, just being in this field would make the problem even worse because I would never be as competent as the quality demands. The skills that I learn from AI quickly become outdated compared to other skills like management and software engineering. Whenever you involve humans in the equation, you have to learn different things surrounding it. But if you are just doing AI research for a long time, all you get is the ability to read papers and perhaps implement them. It&#x27;s always a rat race where you are constantly chasing something new. I feel that doing a regular software engineering job would be much easier and exciting because it&#x27;s just a job and you can have other hobbies. But with AI, you have to read relevant papers on your spare time just to keep up. The innovation and progress are so fast that it&#x27;s almost impossible to catch up.<p>I feel like my career has ended before it even started.",

        "Title": "Discuss HN: Software Careers Post ChatGPT+",
        "Body": "We&#x27;ve all seen it - ChatGPT genuinely solving coding puzzles. Clearly, <i>clearly</i>, that&#x27;s a long way from building MVP products, designing new programming languages or writing &quot;Hello World&quot; in Haskell. But it&#x27;s also a long way since even GPT-3, never mind status quo 10 years ago. It would be cool to discuss what a future looks like where &quot;human operators&quot; of programming are competing against a machine. I don&#x27;t think it is imminent, but equally I think it&#x27;s less imminent than I did a week ago.<p>Some threads that come to mind:<p>- Are these language models better than current offshore outsourced coders? These can code too, sort of, and yet they don&#x27;t threaten the software industry (much).<p>- What would SEs do if any layperson can say &quot;hey AI slave, write me a program that...&quot;? What would we, literally, do? Are there other, undersaturated professions we&#x27;d go into, where analytical thinking is required? Could we, ironically, wake up in a future where thinking skills are taken over by machine, and it&#x27;s other skills - visual, physical labour, fine motor skills - that remain unautomated?<p>- Are we even the first ones in the firing line? Clearly, for now AI progress is mostly in text-based professions; we haven&#x27;t seen a GPT equivalent for video comprehension, for example. Are lawyers at risk? Writers?<p>- What can SEs do, realistically, to protect themselves? Putting the genie back in the bottle is not, as discussed many times in other threads, an option.<p>- Or is it all bogus (with justification), and we&#x27;re fine?<p>No doubt ChatGPT will chip in...",

It prints a URL in the build log and waits for secrets to be entered using a browser. Once entered, the workflow continues, and secrets can be used in future steps.<p>The latest release of &quot;eslint-plugin-react&quot; to the npm registry used a one-time password (OTP) from a GitHub Actions workflow!\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jsx-eslint&#x2F;eslint-plugin-react&#x2F;actions&#x2F;runs&#x2F;3498968497&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;5860126389#step:9:1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jsx-eslint&#x2F;eslint-plugin-react&#x2F;actions&#x2F;ru...</a>",

While freemium might make more sense, this was quicker to release, since in-app-purchases in RN is not trivial. First app I created that&#x27;s not free, so that&#x27;s an experiment too. \n- There are no online features, all is stored on the device.<p>Looking to validate with UX designers, but all feedback is welcome.",
